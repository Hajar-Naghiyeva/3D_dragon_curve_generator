# Dragon Curve 3D Generator

## 📖 What is the Dragon Curve?

The **Dragon Curve** is a type of fractal, a mathematical curve that can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced-size copy of the whole. It is also known as the "Heighway Dragon" and has applications in computer graphics, data representation, and mathematics. The Dragon Curve is constructed through iterative processes, where each iteration folds the previous curve at a right angle. When visualized in 3D, it provides an intriguing and complex structure that can be used in art and design.

This project extends the concept into 3D by giving the curve a height (or depth), allowing users to generate a 3D model of the Dragon Curve as an `.obj` file for visualization in 3D viewers or further processing in 3D software. The application enables customization of parameters such as the number of iterations, depth (height), and filename for saving the file. It uses HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript for generating and rendering the curve.

## 📂 How to Open the `.obj` File

You can open and visualize the generated `.obj` file using any of the following tools:

1. **Microsoft 3D Viewer** (Windows):

* Pre-installed on most Windows 10 and 11 devices.
* Drag and drop the `.obj` file into the viewer to explore the model.

2. **Blender** (Open-source):

* Download and install Blender.
* Open Blender, navigate to File > Import > Wavefront (.obj), and load the file.

3. **MeshLab** (Open-source):

* Download and install MeshLab.
* Open MeshLab and load the .obj file.
